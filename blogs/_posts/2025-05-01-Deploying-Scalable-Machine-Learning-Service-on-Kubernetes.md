## Overview of the Tutorial

This tutorial covers the entire pipeline of deploying a Sentiment Analysis model — from model development to scalable, monitored production deployment on Kubernetes.

**Here's a glimpse of what you will build and learn:**

- Sentiment Analysis Model developed with Scikit-Learn for natural language processing tasks.
- A FastAPI-based REST API serving the model, enabling easy, low-latency inference.
- Containerization using Docker or Podman to package the application and dependencies.
- Kubernetes Deployment, including setup of clusters, persistent storage for model artifacts, and auto-scaling using the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA).
- Real-time monitoring using Prometheus to track application health and performance metrics.

This project equips you with practical MLOps skills to deploy and maintain machine learning applications at scale.
